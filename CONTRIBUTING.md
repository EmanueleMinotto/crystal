# Contributing

Contributes must follow these rules:

 * no vendors code and no namespaces
 * every PHP functionality must be included in the ´microframework.php´ file
 * the [PHP documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/indexes.functions.php) is full of functionalities, use them!
 * the code must be documented (one big file is hard to read, one big undocumented source is impossible to read)
 * every pull request must be documented
